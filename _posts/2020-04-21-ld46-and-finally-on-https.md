HTTPS protection of my domain is finally here! Although it's Cloudflare's free certificate which only protects
the connection between you and Cloudflare and not Cloudflare and GitHub. Nevertheless, there's no inputs here
(especially no ones for credit cards) so we can safely assume that is enough.

What's more I took part in Ludum Dare 46 Compo with my game Save Ivee. I enjoyed making it with all that
adrenaline to finish it on time. However, I had to relearn Haxe in order to write it.

I also seen many games submitted and most of them were really well made!

Some of my favorites:

* [CODE B12](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/code-b12) (just the way it is)
* [Another f****ng escort mission](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/another-fng-escort-mission) (for the narration)
* [Tree Sim](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/ludum-dare-46-entry-tree-sim) (aesthetic)
* [Feed Me!](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/feed-me-3)

See you in LD47!
