Today, I introduced a working [Games](/games/) page.

I created a [generator in Python](https://github.com/furfel/furfel.github.io/blob/master/generategames.py), which converts a csv file into a layout for Jekyll. With the help of Bootstrap and Font Awesome it looks... well... awesome!

What is more I would like to update on my part-taking in [101 Hour Jam](https://itch.io/jam/101-1/rate/629369). I didn't have much time to dwell on this game due to my master
thesis which requires most of my attention currently. However, on Friday I plan to take part in the next edition of 101HJ as well as [MiniJam](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-54-memories).

And also I am verified now on [Keybase](/keybase.txt).
