title: "Finally learning Jekyll!"

Today I decided to finally learn Jekyll. I have heard about that awesome tool
before. However, I never managed to start creating a website in it.

Some time ago, I downloaded a single-page template with gulp. I modified
the code to generate pages and menu to my liking. However, it was very difficult
to mange. I was considering Jekyll before but somehow I dropped the idea.

Luckily, [Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.com) handed out free subscriptions
for a month due to the Covid-19 crisis. At first I was really confused - there
was so much interesting topics to learn. Somehow I decided to type "jekyll"
into the search bar and here I am! Writing my first post in Markdown to be
served on my site.

Altho, still need to use more Markdown to learn it faster.

I also added a fix to `drop.rb` in `jekyll-seo-tag` that checks for the
existence of `site.shortdesc` setting and sets it into the title instead of the
full description.
